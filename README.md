A web app built around an image recognition API that can detect faces in a photo. Front end built with React, backend built with Node and PostGreSQL.

DEMO HERE: https://intelli-123.herokuapp.com/

The image recognition API used is Clarifai: https://clarifai.com/. You will need to use your own API key which you can get for free from the website, and put it in the src/App.js file. I've outlined with comments where to put that in that file.

To use this, make sure you have node/npm installed on your computer. Then clone the repository, and in the directory, enter npm install in the terminal to get the dependencies. Finally, enter npm start to start the web server for the app. Default place to access is localhost:3000 on your browser.

Backend/database source code is available at https://github.com/triqzzz123/IntelliBrain-API

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
